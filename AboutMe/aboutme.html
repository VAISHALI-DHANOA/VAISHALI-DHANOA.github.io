        My research interests lie in data visualization, storytelling with data,
        and human-centered AI. We are currently living in a particularly interesting
        moment, where AI is beginning to fundamentally reshape data analysis practices.
        I am especially interested in understanding how these changes will influence
        the way we work with data.
